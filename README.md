# About
This is a C program that calculates mathematical expressions, written in nested parentheses.  
It was developed as an assingment for the Algorithms and Data Structures III (CI1057) course of the Federal University of Paran√° (UFPR).

# Data Structure used
The main data structure used in this assignment was a binary tree, whose nodes are either numbers or operations.  
It is built from the input string

# How to use it
To use it, execute the following commands inside the project directory:
```bash
$ make
$ ./analisa_expressao
```
Then insert an mathematical expression, written in nested parentheses, such as (*(5)(+(4)(3)).  
The result of the expression will be printed soon after it.
